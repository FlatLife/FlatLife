# FlatLife - A Flat Management App

FlatLife is an app for students and others who live in communal living environments. With this application we aim to make it easier and less stressful for people to manage responsibilities such as bills, chores, eating arrangements etc. Having other added features such as a public noticeboard and arranged activities for members of a household to all have access too will give benefits to everyone.
